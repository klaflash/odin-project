    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"Banana bread is a timeless way to dispose of ripe bananas, but old-school banana bread recipes are often riddled with staggering amounts of sugar and butter. This au naturel banana bread, inspired by Protein Pow's protein-baking wizardry, will taste so banana-y and delicious that you wouldn't believe it's not terrible for you."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium bananas</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup rolled oats</li>
        <li>3 whole eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg whites</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 scoops vanilla whey protein powder</li>
        <li>Optional: Walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Mash the bananas up really well, and whisk in the eggs and milk.</li>
        <li>Blend the rest of the dry ingredients into the mix until it takes on a batter-like consistency.</li>
        <li>Spray a loaf pan and pour in the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake the banana bread for about 35-40 minutes, or until a fork comes out clean when you stab it. One loaf makes about nine 1/4-inch slices.</li>
