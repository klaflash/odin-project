    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"In this healthy twist on lobster mac and cheese, we add a secret ingredient to the cheese sauce: cauliflower. The cauliflower blends into the cheese sauce so you won't even realize you're eating a vegetable. Serve this impressive main dish for a dinner party or holiday meal."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1 pound whole-wheat pasta or chickpea cavatappi pasta</li>
        <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>4 cups chopped cauliflower florets</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, grated</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon saffron threads or smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon ground pepper</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh or thawed frozen cooked lobster meat (from tails, claws and/or knuckles)</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup whole-wheat panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F with rack about 10 inches from heat source. Coat a broiler-safe 9-by-13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Bring a large heavy pot of water to a boil; cook pasta until al dente, according to package directions. Drain; return to the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine milk, cauliflower and garlic in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low; stir in saffron (or paprika), and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower is tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Pour the mixture into a blender (use caution when blending hot liquids). Secure the lid on the blender and remove the center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over the opening. Process until smooth, about 1 minute. (Alternatively, use an immersion blender to process the mixture in the pan until smooth.)</li>
        <li>Return the pureed cauliflower mixture to the pan; bring to a simmer over low heat. Add Cheddar and mozzarella; cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce is smooth and the cheeses are completely melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat; whisk in pepper, salt and crushed red pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour the cauliflower sauce over the pasta in the pot; stir until evenly coated. Stir in lobster. Spoon the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Stir together panko (or cauliflower crumbs) and oil in a small bowl; sprinkle over the pasta mixture. Cover the baking dish with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbling, 40 to 45 minutes Remove from oven and carefully remove foil. Set oven to broil. Broil until the panko is crispy and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
